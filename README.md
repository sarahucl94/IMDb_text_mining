# Aligining subs and DVS text

The 2 IMDB_.py files take user and critic reviews from IMDB for one movie and put them into a .txt file

Word_Valence_Calculator.py groups the words from the paper into a valence category to be used for comparison below


The 2 Wc_by_.py files compare the reviews to the valence words/Neurosynth words for one movie and outputs relevant statistics

The 2 audio_get_.py files analyse the subtitles and output first the times in-between them, which will be when DVS is present. These times are matched to the audio of the movie to output one DVS audio file to be sent to the Google API.
